    "claim": ["structural inequality persists across institutional domains.","bureaucratic inertia often shields existing power configurations.","institutional practices reproduce privilege in subtle yet durable ways.","administrative procedures can normalise exclusion under a fa√ßade of neutrality.","policy frameworks frequently privilege established interests over the marginalised.","organisational cultures may perpetuate patterns of discrimination.","formal rules sometimes conceal informal mechanisms of exclusion.","systemic bias endures despite ostensible commitments to equality."],
    "reason": [", having been shaped by historical policy and entrenched networks,", ", reinforced by economic incentives and administrative routines,", ", owing to long-standing socio-economic stratification,", ", sustained by unequal access to resources and influence,", ", compounded by intergenerational disadvantage,", ", rooted in centuries of discriminatory practice,", ", embedded in institutional architecture,", ", perpetuated through normative assumptions about merit,"],
    "example": ["For instance, redlining and housing policy created entrenched neighbourhood inequalities.","For example, recruitment algorithms can unintentionally replicate bias.","Consider the long-term effects of exclusionary education funding.","Empirical studies show that legacy admissions disadvantage first-generation applicants.","Historical legislation often codified patterns that persist today.","Statistical evidence reveals marked disparities in employment outcomes.","Case studies demonstrate how administrative rules disadvantage particular groups.","Policy reviews indicate systemic blind spots that reinforce inequality."],
    "result": ["Consequently, superficial reforms fail to redress core inequities.","Therefore, substantive structural change is required to achieve justice.","As a result, disparities persist across successive generations.","Hence, only comprehensive policy coupled with participatory governance can effect lasting change.","Thus, piecemeal measures often leave the root causes untouched.","Accordingly, accountability mechanisms must accompany any reform.","Consequently, marginalised communities remain disproportionately affected.","In short, change that ignores underlying structures is likely to be cosmetic."],

    "claim": ["selective historiography fosters cultural amnesia.","national myth-making obscures inconvenient truths.","commemorative practices can be both consolatory and evasive.","collective memory is often contested and politically constituted.","public narratives may prioritise cohesion over accountability.","official pedagogy sometimes sanitises the past for present comfort.","state-sponsored memory can marginalise alternative voices.","cultural narratives may naturalise historical injustices."],
    "reason": ["because key perspectives are suppressed","due to deliberate omission in curricula","as a consequence of political expediency","owing to media framing that simplifies events","considering entrenched power dynamics","given partisan interests in persuasion","in light of institutional reluctance","since official narratives often exclude minority voices"],

    "result": ["This suggests that memory alone does not guarantee justice.","Such patterns indicate a preference for narrative cohesion over restitution.","Therefore, remembrance without reform risks being performative.","Consequently, public pedagogy must be reoriented towards truthfulness.","Hence, honest curricula are essential to democratic deliberation.","Thus, cultural reckoning requires both narrative honesty and institutional change.","In effect, symbolic recognition must be matched by material redress.","In short, memory must be transformed into accountable practice."],

    "claim": ["progress inevitably entails trade-offs that complicate simplistic critiques.","innovation can yield transformative benefits even where risks exist.","policy responses may be slow, but incremental gains are nonetheless real.","ethical dilemmas often require negotiated, context-sensitive solutions.","technological solutions sometimes create new opportunities for inclusion.","market mechanisms can, if regulated, foster wider access to services.","public sentiment may favour pragmatic, stepwise reform over radical overhaul.","some advances demonstrably improve material wellbeing despite ethical complexity."],

    "result": ["Hence, policy must balance innovation with robust ethical frameworks.","Thus, a measured approach can convert potential harms into manageable risks.","Therefore, safeguards and oversight should accompany deployment.","Accordingly, pragmatic regulation can preserve benefits while reducing costs.","In effect, incrementalism may be preferable where wholesale change is impracticable.","Consequently, deliberative governance remains crucial to equitable outcomes.","Ultimately, balancing values and utility is the central policy challenge.","In sum, nuance and restraint should guide reformist ambitions."],
